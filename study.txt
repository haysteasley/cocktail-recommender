For my project, I want to create an interface that creates a cultural object for the user: a drink. 
My project aims to generate a recipe for a drink based on the user's preferences; that they can then make with freinds or family.
Options for users would be whether the drink is a mocktail or alcoholic, glass type, and ingredients.

- preferredIngredients will be an array of all possible ingredients.
- isAlcoholic will be a boolean to whether there is alcohol in the drink or not.
- preferredGlassType will be a string that the user enters.
- recommendedCocktail will then be the object that stores the recommended drink. 

This project will use a Cocktail API, hopefully, that will be used for the user's requests. 

const cocktailData = {
   
    preferredIngredients: ["Tequila", "Vodka"],
    isAlcoholic: true,
    preferredGlassType: "Cocktail glass",

    recommendedCocktail: {
      name: "Margarita",
      category: "Ordinary Drink",
      instructions: "Rub the rim of the glass with the lime slice.",
      ingredients: [
        { name: "Tequila", measure: "1 1/2 oz" },
        { name: "Triple sec", measure: "1/2 oz" },
        { name: "Lime juice", measure: "1 oz" },
        { name: "Salt", measure: null },
      ],
    },

    favoriteCocktails: [
      { name: "Mojito", category: "Cocktail", isAlcoholic: true },
      { name: "Virgin Pina Colada", category: "Non-Alcoholic", isAlcoholic: false },
      { name: "Screwdriver", category: "Cocktail", isAlcoholic: true}

    // Add more sample cocktails here
  ];

  function setInitialRecommendedCocktail() {
    // Select a random sample cocktail
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * sampleCocktails.length);
    cocktailData.recommendedCocktail = sampleCocktails[randomIndex];
  }
 
  function fetchRecommendedCocktail() {
    // Update the recommendedCocktail property with the fetched data
    cocktailData.recommendedCocktail = {
      name: "Screwdriver",

    const newCocktail = { name, category, isAlcoholic };

  fetchRecommendedCocktail();
